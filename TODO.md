The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:

* Push to your remote repository for the first time by doing `git push origin main`.
* Head to your user settings at `https://pypi.org` and setup PyPI trusted publishing.
  In order to do so, you have to head to the "Publishing" tab, scroll to the bottom
  and add a "new pending publisher". The relevant information is:
  * PyPI project name: `numeric`
  * Owner: `Numerical-Analysis-2024`
  * Repository name: `numeric`
  * Workflow name: `pypi.yml`
  * Environment name: not required
* Enable the integration of Readthedocs with your Git hoster. In the case of Github, this means
  that you need to login at [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) and click the button
  *Import a Project*.
